# Robot Mediated Nudging
This repository contains sample expressive behaviors for the workplace break-taking robotic system. These behaviors come from a selected subset of eight categories: Active (A), Pleasant Active (PA), Unpleasant Active (UA), Inactive (I), Pleasant Inactive (PI), Unpleasant Inactive (UI), Pleasant (P), and Unpleasant (U). These categories were designed to span varying energy (active or inactive) and valence (pleasant or unpleasant) levels based on Russel's circumplex model of affect. The files videos enclosed in this repository, as also listed below, represent distinct robot behaviors from four of the overall behavior categories. The break-taking robotic system and research results are further described in a SORO paper submission that is currently under review.
