# Robot Mediated Nudging
This repository contains sample expressive behaviors for the workplace break-taking robotic system. These behaviors belong to eight categories: Active, Pleasant Active, Unpleasant Active, Inactive, Pleasant Inactive, Unpleasant Inactive, Pleasant, and Unpleasant. These categories were designed to spread evenly across Russell's circumplex model of affect. Each of these categories has four associated behaviors. In each category, there is a video file sample of the behaviors. The break-taking robotic system and research results are further described in a SORO paper submission that is currently under review.
